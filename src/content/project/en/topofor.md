description: Topography business site developed for a Spanish company based in
              the north of Spain in Pontevedra.<br><br>
              The site was developed using <b>WordPress</b> since there was no need to
              sell any products and the client demanded to be able to modify their
              own content as well as introduce design changes easily. <b>Elementor</b>
              was used to easily create custom pages that interact easily with all
              platforms and devices. Custom <b>JS and CSS</b> were used sparingly to
              adapt the site to the user needs.
