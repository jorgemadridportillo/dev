description: Topography business site developed for a spanish company based in the north of Spain in Pontevedra. Explore the wonders of topography, drones and the latest
            tech in the field. The site was developed using Wodrpress since there was no need to sell any products and the client demanded to be able to modify their own
            content as well as introduce design changes easily. Elementor was used to easily create custom pages that interact easily with all platforms and devices. Custom JS and Css
            was used sparingly to adapt the site to the user needs.
