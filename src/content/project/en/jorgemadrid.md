description: I am a software engineer with more than 12 years of experience in the field, both as a freelance and working for other companies. After graduating from San Pablo CEU 
            in Madrid I traveled to Denmark and completed a Master in Computer Science at Aalborg University . I like to explore many fields but have been mainly focused in web development and 
            mobile applications. Among my areas of expertise are React, Astro, Remix, Shopify (Hydrogen and Liquid), Wordpress, React Native and PHP, but I am ready to implement
            software solutions beyond this scope if necessary. Below you can check out my linkedin profile and download my resume in PDF.
