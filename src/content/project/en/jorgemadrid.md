description: I am a software engineer with more than 12 years of experience in the
              field, working for both, startups and world leading consultancy and
              technological companies.<br>
              After graduating from San Pablo CEU in Madrid I travelled to Denmark

              and Liquid), WordPress, React Native and PHP, and I am also capable
              to implement software solutions beyond these tools if necessary.
