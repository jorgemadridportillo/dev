description: Aerorioja is a website that explores a fantastic aerodrome in the north
            of Spain (Logroño). The gallery section shows beautiful pictures from
            different planes and landscapes.<br><br>
            Built with care using <b>WordPress</b>, it has been working perfectly since
            its deployment. The website also serves as a portal for users that want
            to log in to their personal area. The pages were built using <b>custom
            code and custom elements with HTML, JS and CSS.</b> The users can
            learn from courses, schedules and contact the owner to reserve
            lessons and experiences.
